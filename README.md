## Introduction

Greetings! I trust this message finds you well. In response to a recent challenge, I conceptualized and developed a fictional music streaming platform as a portfolio project. Despite time constraints preventing the implementation of all envisioned functionalities, all requirements outlined in the challenge were successfully addressed.

## Project Overview

- **Application:** [Music Player](https://shellyda.github.io/music-player-pureJS/player.html)
- **Portfolio Home:** [Index.html](https://shellyda.github.io/music-player-pureJS/)
- **JavaScript Code:** Located in the **elements** folder; CSS code in *css/style.player.css*.
- **Media Assets:** Music and images reside in the **files** and **assets** folders, respectively.
- **Navigation:** Access the player page via buttons on other portfolio pages or navigate through the menu.
- **Responsiveness:** Only the music player screen has responsive behavior.

## Usage Instructions

1. [Explore the Player](https://shellyda.github.io/Music-Player-js/player.html)
2. [Portfolio Home](https://shellyda.github.io/Music-Player-js/)
3. JavaScript code in the **elements** folder; CSS in *css/style.player.css*.
4. Media assets in the **files** and **assets** folders.

### Note:
- Interact with the player through buttons on portfolio pages.
- Navigate seamlessly between pages using the menu.
